                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                    and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
